*Reposted (riposted?) and dated around the time of original publication to my
social media stream from the before times.*
*Dedicated to Adam Solove who said “Yes!”, “Oh, no!”, and “Please stop!” at all
the right moments.*
*For the record, I have dared Adam to tell the fates of the istari who went
east and presumably communed with the dragon maiar who resisted Morgoth’s
corruption.*

We three beings of occident are  
Vetran warriors ’gainst the fallen star  
Stoked the ire  
Of the eye of fire  
Fighting for Telcontar  

**Refrain:**

Oh, istari azure, istari bright  
And the istar of fauna’s might  
Westward leading  
Still proceeding  
Guide us through Ilúvatar’s night  

*(Refrain)*

Five there were from Valinor  
Rómestámo and Morinehtar  
With Olorin  
Aiwendil, all good friends  
But for treasonous Cu’runír  

*(Refrain)*

Saruman fell with Grima Wormtongue  
Gandalf sailed to the isle of song  
Still on Earth  
For what it's worth  
Radagast, Alatar, and Pa’llando  

*(Refrain)*

We three beings of occident are  
Guides from heaven teaching mortals afar  
Mages of Zor’aster  
Wizards none wiser  
Not once kings but heralds of war  

*(Refrain)*

Strange gifts gave Erú to beings mortal  
Yea death, yet e’rlasting will  
For Erú’s son  
Three gifts were brung  
In the light of Eärendil  

*(Refrain)*

Radagast went with the twelve tribes of men  
Wandering conjurer through decades Roman  
Sailed to Britain  
A druid wiccan  
Hid in the guise of wizard Merlin  

*(Refrain)*

’Biding ’tween the Celts and the Church  
There the brown wizard good folk did search  
Found a thief  
The poor’s relief  
And lived for a time a friar as such  

*(Refrain)*

’Neath the ice in halls of Morgoth  
Melkor made the orcs of En’norath  
Elves were tortured  
Dragons nurtured  
In the pits of the dark master’s wrath  

*(Refrain)*

Then Aiwendil went with the will of the pope  
To flush the tunnels of forgotten hope  
Now in Angband  
Elves with free hands  
Live free of Utumno’s rope  

*(Refrain)*

From the frozen boreal halls  
A retired wizard visits Earth’s malls  
Lord of children  
Ever a deer friend  
Now known as Santa Claus  

*(Refrain)*

In the company of Saint Nick the red  
Eight caribou he tied to a sled  
Dasher Vixen  
Donner Blitzen  
And a reindeer named Rudolf led  

*(Refrain)*

*(Refrain once more to clear the room)*
