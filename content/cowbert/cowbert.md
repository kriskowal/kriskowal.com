I no longer recall when I made this, but I was still in high school.
I drew these by hand, scanned them, blurred, and boosted the contrast until the
outlines were solid, then filled the cells digitally.
I used PowerPoint to add the background gradients and export as GIF.
Compuserve was still enforcing the GIF patent at the time and PowerPoint was
the only tool I had that could make a GIF.

This is the origin of my Cowbert moniker as appeared in my
`cowbert@hotmail.com` address, “Cowbert von Moo” handle on AOL Instant
Messenger, and my primary email handling account until 2024.

This is the only Cowbert comic I made.
The trope was stale then and isn’t less relevant now.
