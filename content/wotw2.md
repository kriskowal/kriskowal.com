Last week, Josh Lewis‚Äîfriend, former Apple
colleague, and [Lex Luthor hairstyle enthusiast](https://web.archive.org/web/20090319014354/http://www.friendlystegosaurus.com/2007/10/09/052-pastabrain-was-already-taken/)‚Äîgot
me thinking about [fiction on Twitter](https://web.archive.org/web/20081202114607/http://blog.joshlewis.org/2008/10/03/twitter-fiction/).
Then, Ryan Paul pointed out that he had written [an article about Twitter fiction](http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080901-byte-sized-stories-twittering-a-tiny-tale.html)
already.

Here‚Äôs the idea.
Let‚Äôs (and by
‚Äúus‚Äù, I mean everyone) reenact
[The War of the Worlds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_War_of_the_Worlds_\(radio\)),
on the Internet, for Halloween!

CBS ran the Orsen Welles War of the Worlds radio program in the tense times
leading up to the second World War.  The aforementioned Wikipedia article
claims that Adolf Hitler denounced the program as a sign of democratic
decadence.  Without commercial breaks and interpolated among real news, the
program was broadcast in earnest and public panic ensued.  War of the Worlds
was the ultimate Prank, never to be reproduced.  As an homage, let‚Äôs take
Halloween to tweet, share bookmarks and status messages, and blog in earnest
about the alien invasion in progress.  Everyone, tell *your* story.

The War of the Worlds has several phases that I believe have strong analogs in
the tense times leading to World Web II (point oh).

1. a noteworthy astronomer speculates on the possibility of an alien invasion.
   This would be a good time to talk about the 
   [Drake equation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation)
   in your blog,
   especially if astronomy is your hobby.  Send an email to `wotw@cixar.com`
   with your blog so we can proliferate it on the 
   [@wotw2](http://twitter.com/wotw2) Twitter account.
2. The alien invasion occurs.  Follow [@wotw2](http://twitter.com/wotw2) to
   keep in sync with the progress of the invasion.  This Twitter feed will
   automatically update, in general terms, the unfolding of the alien invasion
   like clockwork throughout the world.  Coordinate with Tweeters in your area
   to tell local stories.
  1.  cylinders fall from the sky.  Tweet about where you are.  Ask your
      friends where they are.  Form posses.  Skip town or take a closer look.
  2. tripods emerge.  Flee, get stuck in traffic, or take refuge and tell us
     what you see.
  3. Martians begin obliterating every Terran metropolitan area with heat rays.
     Don't call them heat-rays; that would be a dead giveaway.  Describe what
     they do and come up with your own name!  Do you work in a public service
     like hospitals or fire?  What‚Äôs your job and what do you do?  Do you
     organize your coworkers and flee?  Do you head for the hills with your
     go-bag?
  4. Military, local militia, and national guard units get organized and attack
     the alien invaders.  Do you serve in the military?  This is your last
     chance to tell us where you're headed.  Do you have family in a militia?
     Try to keep in touch and let us know how and where they valiantly fought
     and lost.
  5. The invasion spreads from cities to countryside.
  6. Tripods begin to shut down an malfunction.  Are you near one?  Do you take
     a closer look?
3. After the threat dies down, people begin to blog and speculate about what
   happened, and every topic near and dear to them.
4. The curtain rises.  Blog, link, and tweet about the experience.

The ‚ÄúWar of the Worlds 2.0‚Äù event will be synchronized, on Halloween Friday,
with the [@wotw2](http://twitter.com/wotw2) account and we‚Äôre writing automation with
Ryan Paul‚Äôs [Gwibber](https://launchpad.net/gwibber) tool to automatically
post Tweets to various services on that day.  If you would like to make
additional accounts to synchronize local events, please send an email to
`wotw2@cixar.com` with a Twitter account name and password and we'll hook you
up with edit privileges for the
**tweet plan** (‚ò†Ô∏èüîó) on Google Docs.
Tweets (rows) will be deployed for each column (account).  

Let‚Äôs tell a story!

  that Josh Lewis called into to advertise the event
- [The Call of Cthubuntu](http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20081031-the-call-of-cthubuntu.html)
  wherein Ryan Paul plugged the event on Arstechnica.

- [Archive ‚ò†Ô∏èüîó](http://cixar.com/svn/wotw2) of everything we could scrape when
  the event concluded and we realized we were going to want an archive to build
  cool visualizations from.  The archive includes source code you can use to
  perform your own automated tweets in conjunction with 
  [@segphault](http://twitter.com/segphault)‚Äôs
  [Gwibber](https://launchpad.net/gwibber) microblog Python library.

Each participant averaged 2.6 tweets total.
The most active participants posted 60 to 100 tweets.
There were around 600 people following the invasion progress.
That‚Äôs about 1500 tweets for all participants over the course of the event.
I think it‚Äôs safe to assume that about 10,000 people were touched by these
apocalyptic tidings.

That was a lot of fun.  We'll have to do something similar again some time.
