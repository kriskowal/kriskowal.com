At [tengwar.3rin.gs](https://tengwar.3rin.gs) you will find a transcriber for
the elvish languages that J.R.R.&nbsp;Tolkien created and appear in *Lord of
the Rings*, *The Hobbit*, *The Silmarillion*, and other works of his
“Legendarium”.

**I would advise you to *pay an expert* to check your work before imprinting a
transcription on metal or your own flesh.**

This is a good tool for doing a first-approximation transcription and does not
capture all the nuances of Tolkien’s ever-changing [modes for writing
Elvish](https://tengwar.3rin.gs/modes.html).
However, this tool is much more polite than typing out the [underlying text by
hand](https://www.acondia.com/fonts/):

> ```
> tlE xr^5#P5$= 7E2`CÁ
> ```

I also produced a [prototype for a transcriber that shows its
work](https://gutentags.github.io/tengwar.html/):

Visit [the about page](https://tengwar.3rin.gs/about.html) to learn about
the creation of this tool.
The software behind the transcriber is open source:

- [tengwarjs](https://github.com/kriskowal/tengwarjs) is the JavaScript library
  that performs the transcription and an example of [the design pattern that
  shall not be named](/tdptsnbn). This tool supports continuous deployment
  to [tengwar.3rin.gs](https://tengwar.3rin.gs) using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
  which means that you (*yes, you*) can help prevent typos in tattoos and
  [wedding rings](https://www.jenshansen.com/).
- [@gutentags/tengwar.html](https://github.com/gutentags/tengwar.html) is the
  latter “self-explaining transcriber”.

To learn about the Tengwar, the best resource available is Måns Björkman Berg’s
[Amanye Tenceli](https://at.boktypografen.se/).
[Parf Edhellen](https://www.elfdict.com/) is the best resource for casually
discovering Elvish vocabulary.
