[{% image "elvish.png", "Elvish Middle-earth map" %}](https://3rin.gs)

In 2010, I created an [online map of J.R.R. Tolkienâ€™s
Middle-earth](https://3rin.gs) as was depicted in *The Hobbit* and *The Lord of
the Rings*.
The map includes layers in both English and Elvish and provides notes for
various points of interest.

I also wrote up the [process I used to create the map](https://3rin.gs/about.html).

The material is [open source](https://github.com/kriskowal/3rin.gs) and I would
be delighted to take an understudy to someone interested in improving upon this
aging website.
