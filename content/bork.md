In the Before Times, [Corbin](https://github.com/jcorbin),
[Rix](https://arcology.garden), [Tor](), and I
were so energized by [Roguelike Celebration](https://www.roguelike.club/), we
swore a oath in the presence of Github's Octocat that we would
make a Roguelike and talk about it at a future Roguelike.
To that end we have done much and achieved little.
But, as we understand it, striving to make games that nobody in their right
mind would willingly play is not only common but customary and arguably
the unstated purpose of the endeavor.

The tentative notion was to build <em>BØRK: Escape the Scandinavian Home
Furnishings Labyrinth</em>.
The game would be about hunger and will-power in a vast, endless expanse of
meandering procedurally generated show rooms, contemplating the will
of a designer that created a space that people would willingly mill about,
visiting absolutely every square with no prayer of summary or
foreshortening, except tantalizing shortcuts that are as likely to send
you forward or backward in your quest for the exit.

This is not that game.

We informally incorporated the [BØRKSHOP](https://github.com/borkshop/) and
proceded to play a great deal of Minecraft.

But, over the course of these many years, we made many other things.
We wrote half of [ANSI bindings for Go](https://github.com/kriskowal/cops), [at
least twice](https://github.com/jcorbin/anansi).
We discovered that terminals can't do emojis reliably.
We wrote half of [Emoji Quest](https://emojiquest.app/), [at least
twice](https://github.com/borkshop/lobsterquest).
We discovered that doing 3D graphics and text layout with color emojis in the
same app is nearly impossible.
We [contributed to OpenMoji](https://openmoji.org/library/#author=Kris%20Kowal)
including some fancy [JISH](/jish) [build
scripts](https://github.com/hfg-gmuend/openmoji/tree/master/helpers).
We even [prototyped BØRK in Go](https://github.com/borkshop/gobork).

What you see above and at
[BØRK](http://bork.kriskowal.com/f88eefde53a30e538cee81ea314c1ebe258e0a8a146d6d454c2f2b2145cb7479.html)
is not a Roguelike game.  It is Roguelike art.  We never settled upon how to
furnish BØRK's bedazzling showrooms, but since I’ve been making bootlego
building bløks for my kids on the 3D printer, and since
[OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/) is a parametric 3D modeling language with a
command-line toolchain, <em>BØRK: The Scandinavian BLØK Labyrinth</em> has been
a small script diversion from my professional programming.

I will leave as a mystery for the reader how this maze wanders, how its halls
are numbered, the variety and purposes of the bløks you will find, and the
perverse dialect of its purported builders.
It is not a game, but if it is an art, it is subjective.
I can say that I have liberally and deliberately mocked every corner of
Scandinavia except Finland.
