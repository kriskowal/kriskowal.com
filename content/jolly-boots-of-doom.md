During my brief whirlwind experience working at Apple right out of college, I
may have done some very thorough Garage Band testing for a Mac OS software
update.
Many of my colleagues may have contributed.
They may have included Josh Lewis (tenor), Jonathan Deutsch (guitar), Phil
Holland, Carol Leong (alto, as Carol Le), Michael Foquette (narrator), Damien
Soresso (narrator), Andrew Wooster (beep boop), Mark Firth (narrator), Mike
Smochko (beat box).
I may have been able to sing in three octaves and play euphonium at the time.
